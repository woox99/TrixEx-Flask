## About TrixEx

TrixEx is a social platform designed for web developers to exchange front-end components. TrixEx is a full-stack demo project for my [portfolio](https://woox99.github.io/Portfolio/), and was my first non-tutorial project built. You can get the full feel for the site without creating an account [here](http://3.144.111.10/index).
